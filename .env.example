# DEPRECATED: This project uses .env only
#
# This file is intentionally left as a stub to avoid confusion.
# Configure all environment variables in the root .env file instead.
#
# Notes:
# - .env is already ignored by Git (.gitignore), so your secrets stay local.
# - The backend loads .env via `import "dotenv/config"`.
# - Frontend variables must be prefixed with VITE_ to be exposed to the client.

# No variables here on purpose. Use .env only.
